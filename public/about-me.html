<h1>Hi, Im Evee!</h1>

<p> 
    I'm a currently a DevOps engineer, trained in sound engineering with a background as a live events technician, mainly based in theatre. Maybe not the most conventional background, but definately a fun one!
</p>

<p>
    As you have probably guessed, I love trying new things, as well as learning along the way. I'm loving my current job doing DevOps for Automotive Visualisation, but also eager to learn about web development and expand my knowledge even further. 
</p>

<p> 
    I'm following <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/"> Angela Yu's Web Development Bootcamp on Udemy</a> to get a grasp of things, and make some projects along the way.
</p>

<p> 
    When I'm not getting stuck in to some new projects, I love getting out into the fells and walking and playing football! I also love to Boulder when I get the time, and have been having a go at snowboarding when we've had the time and funds. 90% of my time is spent with my dogs, as we love exploring together (and it's definately not because we're constantly working on his seperation anxiety)
