<h1>My favourite places so far</h1>

   <h2> <li> Rydal Mount and Water </li></h2> 
   <p>
        This was one of Mooses first "big" walks. Whether we're kayaking on rydal water, or exploring the nearby fells, it's always a lovely day out.

<h2> <li> Castlerigg </li></h2>
<p> Our first holiday and it rained! It will always be a special place to go back to, and I love waking up to the surrounding view out of our little tent. Exploring the markets, playing cards, and drinking beer whilst the rain hammers your tent; theres actually nothing else I'd rather do </p>

    <li><a href="https://www.castlerigg.co.uk/"> Castlerigg Hall, the OG</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://castleriggfarm.com/"> A link to the farm campsite, because the hall is always full!</a> </li>
